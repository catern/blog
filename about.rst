I may switch this site to something other than the default, out-of-the-box Hakyll configuration at some point.
But don't count on it.

Ideally there'd be some kind of equivalent of LaTeX for websites, 
so writing my content comes first and the layout is all automagically generated,
but at the moment I think static site generators is the closest I can get.
