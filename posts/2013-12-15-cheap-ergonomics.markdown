title: Using a Japanese thumb-shift keyboard for cheap ergonomics

Your thumbs are almost tragically underutilized in traditional keyboards.
Take a moment and type a sentence or two, and notice which thumb you hit the spacebar with.
Most people use the right thumb exclusively.

This is extremely wasteful.
The natural solution is to split the spacebar up, and assign the thumbs to hit some additional keys now within their reach.
This will lighten the load on the other fingers and perhaps, if carefully chosen, help keep the hands on the home row.

Some ergonomic keyboards do exactly this.

However, I'm far too cheap to spend a couple hundred bucks on a keyboard that I might not even like.

Luckily, [Japanese thumb shift keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb-shift_keyboard)  exist and are as cheap as a normal keyboard.

I paid a few dollars on eBay to get mine.

I immediately remapped the thumb-keys to Super, Backspace, Space, Enter, in order.

Space, of course, had to stay under my right thumb, and I placed it on the key that felt most natural.
I chose the others based on some rough estimations of the cost of pressing keys, weighted by how often I press those keys.
Backspace was fairly obvious for me.
It's way up in the right corner and is pressed by the pinky, and I press it pretty often because my life is filled with mistakes.
I press Enter quite a bit as do most programmers, and it's also pressed by the relatively weak pinky, so it went onto a key.
Super is already in a reasonably easy to press position, but I'm constantly hitting it to control my window manager, so it was also a natural choice.

Other keys like Alt (which I can hit by tucking my left thumb)
or Ctrl (which is already on my Caps Lock key)
or Escape (which I have on a mode switch mapping, more on that in a later post) might also be good choices.

I've been using this keyboard and these bindings exclusively on my desktop for about a year now, and I quite like it.
I haven't run into any problems.
My thumb isn't missing when I try to hit space.
I'm still completely able to use a normal keyboard
(surprisingly so - there's not even any transition time when I start to use a normal keyboard after using my own!).
On the other hand, the low monetary cost and the (possibly totally subjective) benefit of less hand movement and more balanced finger usage make this a definite win.
Since it can be very cheap to buy one of these keyboards, I encourage everyone to try it out if they can.
It could save you from painful carpal tunnel syndrome 10 years down the line.
