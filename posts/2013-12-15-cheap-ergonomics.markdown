title: Using a Japanese thumb-shift keyboard for cheap ergonomics
author: catern

Your thumbs are almost tragically underutilized in traditional keyboards.
Take a moment and type a sentence or two, and notice which thumb you hit the spacebar with.
It seems that a large majority of people (including me) use the right thumb exclusively.
This is interesting because the right thumb doesn't seem to have any advantage over the left thumb.
Indeed, there are fewer keys on the left side of the keyboard, so it seems like the left thumb should have the advantage!
Possibly there's some minute advantage for a new learner, and the habit of using the right thumb has fed back into itself over time.

Anyway, the left thumb is either totally unused or a useless duplicate of the right thumb.
This is a travesty!
When faced with such waste, any reasonable person must immediately set themselves to determining ways to make use of the left thumb.
The most obvious is to split the spacebar in two, and assign some other key to the left portion.
This is still rather wasteful, though.
Most fingers have to divide their attention between at least four separate keys, which might generate eight different glyphs between them.
It would be better still to provision each thumb with a number of keys to press to lighten the load on the other fingers.

Some ergonomic keyboards do exactly this.

However, I'm far too cheap to spend a couple hundred bucks on a keyboard that I might not even like.

Luckily, Japanese thumb shift keyboards (link) exist and are as cheap as a normal keyboard.

I paid a few dollars on eBay to get mine.

Thumb shift keyboards split the spacebar into four keys (one of which is a space) to aid in typing the three alphabets that make up the Japanese language.
I've never actually used it for that purpose, and I don't know anything about Japanese, so I couldn't tell you anything more than that.

I immediately remapped the thumb-keys to Super, Backspace, Space, Enter, in order.
Space, of course, had to stay under my right thumb, and I placed it on the key that felt most natural.
I chose the others based on some rough estimations of the cost of pressing keys, weighted by how often I press those keys.
Backspace was fairly obvious for me.
It's way up in the right corner and is pressed by the pinky, and I press it pretty often because my life is filled with mistakes.
I press Enter quite a bit as do most programmers, and it's also pressed by the relatively weak pinky, so it went onto a key.
Super is already in a reasonably easy to press position, but I'm constantly hitting it to control my window manager, so it was also a natural choice.
Other keys like Alt (which I can hit by tucking my left thumb)
or Ctrl (which is already on my Caps Lock key)
or Escape (which I have on a mode switch mapping, more on that in a later post) are also good choices.

I've been using this keyboard and these bindings for about a year now, and I'm liking it quite a bit.
I haven't run into any problems.
My thumb isn't missing when I try to hit space.
I'm still completely able to use a normal keyboard
(surprisingly so - there's not even any transition time when I start to use a normal keyboard after using my own!).
On the other hand, the extremely low monetary cost and the subjective benefit of less hand movement and more balanced finger usage make this a definite win.
Since it can be very cheap to buy one of these keyboards, I encourage everyone to try it out if they can.
It could save you from painful carpal tunnel syndrome 10 years down the line.
