title: Using a Japanese thumb-shift keyboard for cheap ergonomics

Your thumbs are almost tragically underutilized with traditional keyboards.
Take a moment and type a sentence or two, and notice which thumb you hit the spacebar with.
Most people use the right thumb exclusively.

This is quite wasteful.
The natural solution is to split the spacebar up, and assign the thumbs to hit some additional keys now within their reach.
This will lighten the load on the other fingers and perhaps, if carefully chosen, help keep the hands on the home row.

Some ergonomic keyboards do exactly this.

The [Kinesis Advantage](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm) contoured keyboard:

The [Ergodox](http://ergodox.org/) hobbyist-made keyboard:

Unfortunately, both of these have pricetags of a couple hundred dollars.

Luckily, [Japanese thumb shift keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb-shift_keyboard) exist and are as cheap as a normal keyboard.

I paid a few dollars on eBay to get mine.

I immediately remapped the thumb-keys to Super, Backspace, Space, Enter, in that order.

I picked Backspace and Enter because they're extremely frequently pressed by the weakest finger, the pinky. 
The choice of Super was driven by my window manager.

Other keys like Alt (which I can hit by tucking my left thumb)
or Ctrl (which is already on my Caps Lock key)
or Escape (which I have on a mode switch mapping, more on that in a later post) might also be good choices.

I've been using this keyboard and these bindings exclusively on my desktop for about a year now, and I quite like it.

I haven't run into any problems.
My thumb isn't missing when I try to hit space.
I'm still completely able to use a normal keyboard, surprisingly.
There doesn't even seem to be any transition time when I start to use a normal keyboard after using my own.

On the other hand, the low monetary cost and the (possibly totally subjective) benefit of less hand movement and more balanced finger usage make this a definite win.

Since it can be very cheap to buy one of these keyboards, I encourage everyone to try it out if they can.
It could save you from painful carpal tunnel syndrome 10 years down the line.
